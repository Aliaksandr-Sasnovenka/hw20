A little about testing

Types of Testing in Agile
1. Acceptance test-driven development
2. Behavior-driven development
3. Exploratory Testing in Agile
4. Session-Based Testing
   # Agile Testing Strategy (when AGILE is not required)
When the project scope is crystal clear and very unlikely to change
When the project is governed by a single product owner or stakeholder with minimal requirements
When the people on your team lack the deep, broad skills necessary to perform Agile testing
When the customer insists on using a traditional waterfall approach to testing
